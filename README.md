# Introduction

A repository for the High Level Synthesis (HLS) course exercises and final project.
HLS is about a high-level specification of a problem written in code (predominantly C++) that through programs such as
**Catapult** automatically synthesize a register-transfer level structure that realizes the given behavior.
This repository contains the C++ code and not the synthesized circuit.

## Final Project
My chosen final project tackles the common problem of Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs.
Using Depth-First Search(DFS) while respecting the HLS rules & constraits as well as weighting performance, the C++ code
is the bases from which Catapult will synthesize the accelarator. 

### How to Run
Anyway you can compile & run C++ code. Headers needed and saved in 'include' folders.
